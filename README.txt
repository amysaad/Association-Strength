Short description:
This program takes the input for three (x,y) coordinates from the user. It then
calculates the strength of the association (strong, moderate, weak) and the correlation 
coefficient by using the correlation coefficient equation.

**For random, uncomment lines 46-48 in main.cpp, and comment out lines 43-45. Vice Versa for user input.

Files included:
README.txt - this file
main.cpp   - a start to the source code for the root finding program
vitalSigns.cpp - functions
vitalSigns.h - lists call functions

YOU UPDATE THIS message: 
This code is ready.


Status of program:
All inputs work.
